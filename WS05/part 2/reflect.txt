This workshop involved the use of functors, lambda expressions and error handling. The functor and lambda expression are similar however the lambda function is simply a nameless functor. The main case where a lambda is used is when there is not much reuse of a function aside from a section or two however if it is a section that is being constantly used a functor is better. In addition, a lambda cannot template so that area specifically a functor must be used. The way to address the exception handling for the SpellChecker on the constructor side could be to have a flag indicating readable or not and on the client side to read the flag, displaying the error if the flag is triggered. The way to optimize the movie and book is to create a base class that has the common features and derive the book and movie specifying the specializations. When creating a class normally is there is no constructors defined the compiler will generate a default. However, when there is at least 1 constructor this means that the compiler will look for the default along with the other types defined thus requiring the definition of the default. This could simply just mean like done in the lab, to have a default constructor with no body.
